1. Your task is to create a “guestbook” application. That is, you will build a website that has a “home” page, a “leave a note” page and a “read notes left by others” page (you can name those pages in any way you like).

   -Your home page will greet visitors and provide links to the other pages.
   -Your “leave a note” page will contain a form and a submit button.
   -Your “read notes left by others” page will display the notes left before in a list.
   -Your website also needs to have a “404-Not” Found page for any other requests coming from unrecognized routes.

2. All your html pages should be in a “views” folder.

3. In your routes module, you should send your html files as a response to the incoming requests.

4. Style all your pages using a single main.css file. Your stylesheet should be located in a “public” folder.

5. Save and upload all your work on Google Classroom to Week 1 > Lab 3 Submission.
